<p>Here is some code that I've worked on professionally. You can <a href="/resume.html">find more details in my resume</a>:</p>

<ul class="professional">
  <li class="clearfix">
    <div><img src="/assets/images/khan-academy-logo.png" /></div>
    <div>
      <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" class="title">Khan Academy</a>
      <p>Khan Academy seeks to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. I help develop their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id469863705">iOS app</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.khanacademy.android">Android app</a>, as seen on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/20/7560373/khan-academy-ipad-app-update">The Verge</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/09/16/khan-academy-is-bringing-its-library-of-lessons-to-android/">The Next Web</a>, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/23/khan-academy-brings-its-free-learning-to-android/">Engadget</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="clearfix">
    <div><img src="/assets/images/burner-logo.png" /></div>
    <div>
      <a href="http://www.burnerapp.com/" class="title">Burner</a>
      <p>Burner provides temporary and disposable phone numbers for online dating, Craigslist, and more. While there I productionized the backend while increasing test coverage from 0% to over 90%. I also wrote <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhoclabs.burner">the Android app</a> in its entirety, as seen on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/get-a-disposable-number-for-android-with-the-new-burner-app/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5994268/burner-the-single+serving-phone-number-app-is-now-for-android">Gizmodo</a>, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5994262/burner-brings-disposable-phone-numbers-to-android-for-private-calls-texts-and-more">Lifehacker</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="clearfix">
    <div><img src="/assets/images/google-docs-logo.png" /></div>
    <div>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" class="title">Google Docs</a>
      <p>Google Docs allows creating and editing documents online while collaborating with other users in real-time. I enhanced the sharing functionality for files and folders, and helped keep the product running smoothly in production.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here are some open-source projects that I've worked on. You can <a href="https://github.com/mgp">find the rest on GitHub</a>:</p>

<ul class="open-source">
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/mgp/iron-cushion" class="title">Iron Cushion</a>
    <p>Benchmarks and load tests <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, a document-oriented and RESTful database. Gathers statistics for both bulk insert and CRUD operations. I wrote this to verify that CouchDB could handle all the data that <a href="http://burnerapp.com/">Burner</a> would throw at it. Currently used by <a href="https://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/mgp/tarsnap-manager" class="title">Tarsnap Manager</a>
    <p>Manages daily, weekly, and monthly backups on <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a>. When run as a daily cron job, older backups are deleted as newer ones are created, while more recent dates have smaller intervals between backups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sxse/" class="title">Side-by-side Search Comparison Tool</a>
    <p>Compares side-by-side the results of two different search providers. Written so that <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/products/gsa.html">Google search appliance</a> customers could compare different <a href="https://developers.google.com/search-appliance/documentation/614/help_gsa/serve_scoring">scoring policies</a>. After some press by <a href="http://readwrite.com/2009/08/19/google-wants-you-to-do-side-by-side-comparisons-in-search">ReadWriteWeb</a> and <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2051932/Google-Enterprise-Labs-Launches-Side-By-Side-Search-Tool">Search Engine Watch</a>, it was mistaken as a challenge to Bing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
