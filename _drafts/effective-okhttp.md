[OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) was an invaluable library when developing the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.khanacademy.android) for [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). While its default configuration offers significant utility, below are some steps we took for increasing the resourcefulness and introspective power of OkHttp:

### 1. Enable response caching on the filesystem

By default, OkHttp does not cache responses that permit caching by including such a HTTP `Cache-Control` header. Therefore your client may be wasting time and bandwidth by requesting the same resource again and again, as opposed to simply reading a cached copy after the initial response.

To enable caching of responses on the filesystem, configure a `com.squareup.okhttp.Cache` instance and pass it to the `setCache` method of your `OkHttpClient` instance. You must instantiate the `Cache` with a `File` representing a directory, and a maximum size in bytes. Responses that can be cached are written to the given directory. If the caching of a response causes the directory contents to exceed the given size, responses are evicted while adhering to a [LRU policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#LRU).

As [recommended by Jesse Wilson](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32752861/400717), we cache responses in a subdirectory of `context.getCacheDir()`:

```java
// Base directory recommended by http://stackoverflow.com/a/32752861/400717.
// Guard against null, which is possible according to
// https://groups.google.com/d/msg/android-developers/-694j87eXVU/YYs4b6kextwJ and
// http://stackoverflow.com/q/4441849/400717.
final @Nullable File baseDir = context.getCacheDir();
if (baseDir != null) {
  final File cacheDir = new File(baseDir, "HttpResponseCache");
  okHttpClient.setCache(new Cache(cacheDir, HTTP_RESPONSE_DISK_CACHE_MAX_SIZE));
}
```

In the Khan Academy application, we specify `HTTP_RESPONSE_DISK_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` as `10 * 1024 * 1024`, or 10 MB.

### 2. Integrate with Stetho

[Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) is a lovely library by Facebook that allows you to inspect your Android application using the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/workspace/setup-devtools) feature of Chrome. 

In addition to allowing you to inspect the SQLite databases and view hierarchies of your application, Stetho allows you to inspect each request and response made by OkHttp:

This introspection is very useful for ensuring that the server is returning the HTTP headers that permit caching of resources, as well as verifying that no requests are made when cached resources should exist.

To enable Stetho, simply add a `StethoInterceptor` instance to the list of network interceptors:

```java
okHttpClient.networkInterceptors().add(new StethoInterceptor());
```

Then, after running your application, open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`. The device and application identifier of the application should be listed. Visit its "inspect" link to open the Developer Tools, and then open the Network tab to begin monitoring requests by OkHttp.

### 3. Use your client with Retrofit and Picasso

If you are like us, you might use [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) to load images over the network, or use [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to simplify issuing requests and decoding responses. By default, these libraries will implicitly create their own `OkHttpClient` for internal use if you do not explicitly specify one. For example, from the `OkHttpDownloader` class of version 2.5.2 of Picasso:

```java
private static OkHttpClient defaultOkHttpClient() {
  OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
  client.setConnectTimeout(Utils.DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
  client.setReadTimeout(Utils.DEFAULT_READ_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
  client.setWriteTimeout(Utils.DEFAULT_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
  return client;
}
```

Again, Retrofit has a similar method for creating its own `OkHttpClient`.

Note that it is especially beneficial for Picasso to use your `OkHttpClient` instance with response caching enabled. Images are some of the largest resources that your application will load. While Picasso maintains its own LRU cache for images, it is strictly in-memory. If the client attempts to load an image using Picasso, and Picasso does not find that image in its in-memory LRU cache, then it will delegate loading that image to its internal `OkHttpClient` instance. And that `OkHttpClient` instance will always load the image from the server, because as seen in the `defaultOkHttpClient` method above, that `OkHttpClient` instance does not have response caching enabled.

By configuring Picasso with your own `OkHttpClient` instance with caching enabled, then when Picasso delegates loading an image to its `OkHttpClient` instance because that image is not found in its in-memory LRU cache, that `OkHttpClient` can potentially satisfy the request by returning a response from its cache on the filesystem. It will not load the image from the server.

To use your own `OkHttpClient` instance, you must build a `Picasso` instance that is configured with your client. If you are loading images by using `Picasso.with(context).load(...)` in your code, then you are using the `Picasso` singleton instance, which is lazily instantiated and configured with its own `OkHttpClient` by method `with`. Therefore we must build the `Picasso` instance and assign it as the singleton instance before the first call to `with`.

To do this, simply wrap the `OkHttpClient` instance in an `OkHttpDownloader`, and pass that to the `downloader` method of your `Picasso.Builder` instance:

```java
final Picasso picasso = new Picasso.Builder(context)
    .downloader(new OkHttpDownloader(okHttpClient))
    .build();

// The client should inject this instance whenever it is needed, but replace the singleton
// instance just in case.
Picasso.setSingletonInstance(picasso);
```

To use your `OkHttpClient` instance with a `RestAdapter` in Retrofit 1.9.x, wrap the `OkHttpClient` in an `OkClient` instance, and pass that to the `setClient` method of your `RestAdapter.Builder` instance:

```java
restAdapterBuilder.setClient(new OkClient(httpClient));
```

In Retrofit 2.0, simply pass the `OkHttpClient` instance to the `client` method of your `Retrofit.Builder` instance.

In the Khan Academy application, we leverage [Dagger](http://google.github.io/dagger/) to ensure that we have only one `OkHttpClient` instance, and that it is used by both Picasso and Retrofit. We create a provider for the `OkHttpClient` instance with the `@Singleton` annotation:

```java
@Provides
@Singleton
public OkHttpClient okHttpClient(final Context context, ...) {
  final OkHttpClient okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient();
  configureClient(okHttpClient, ...);
  return okHttpClient;
}
```

This `OkHttpClient` is then injected with Dagger into the other providers that create our `RestAdapter` and `Picasso` instances.

### 4. Specify a user agent interceptor

Log files and analytics are much more informative when clients provide a detailed `User-Agent` header value in every request. By default, OkHttp includes a `User-Agent` value that specifies only the version of OkHttp. To specify your own user agent, first create an interceptor that replaces the value, [following this suggestion on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27840834/400717):

```java
public final class UserAgentInterceptor implements Interceptor {
  private static final String USER_AGENT_HEADER_NAME = "User-Agent";
  private final String userAgentHeaderValue;

  public UserAgentInterceptor(String userAgentHeaderValue) {
    this.userAgentHeaderValue = Preconditions.checkNotNull(userAgentHeaderValue);
  }

  @Override
  public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException {
    final Request originalRequest = chain.request();
    final Request requestWithUserAgent = originalRequest.newBuilder()
        .removeHeader(USER_AGENT_HEADER_NAME)
        .addHeader(USER_AGENT_HEADER_NAME, userAgentHeaderValue)
        .build();
    return chain.proceed(requestWithUserAgent);
  }
}
```

To construct the `User-Agent` header value that is passed into the constructor of `UserAgentInterceptor`, use whatever values you would find informative. We use:

* an `os` value of `Android` to clearly communicate that this is an Android device
* `Build.MODEL`, or the "end-user-visible name for the end product"
* `Build.BRAND`, or the "consumer-visible brand with which the product/hardware will be associated"
* `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT`, or the "user-visible SDK version of the [Android] framework"
* `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID`
* `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME`
* `BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE`

The last three values are specified by the `applicationId`, `versionCode`, and `versionName` values in our Gradle build script. For more information, consult the documents on [versioning your applications](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/versioning.html), and on [configuring your `applicationId` with Gradle](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/applicationid-vs-packagename).


### 5. Specify reasonable timeouts

Before version 2.5.0, OkHttp requests defaulted to never timing out. Starting with version 2.5.0, a request times out if establishing a connection, reading the next byte from a connection, or writing the next byte to a connection takes more than 10 seconds to complete. Doing nothing more than updating to version 2.5.0 revealed bugs in our own code, simply because we began exercising certain error paths for the first time. To override these default values, invoke `setConnectTimeout`, `setReadTimeout` or `setWriteTimeout` respectively.

Note that Picasso or Retrofit specify different timeout values for their default `OkHttpClient` instances. By default, Picasso specifies:

* A connect timeout of 15 seconds.
* A read timeout of 20 seconds.
* A write timeout of 20 seconds.

Whereas Retrofit specifies:

* A connect timeout of 15 seconds.
* A read timeout of 20 seconds.
* No write timeout.

By configuring Picasso and Retrofit with your own `OkHttpClient` instance, you can ensure consistent timeouts by all requests.

### Conclusion

Again, the default configuration of OkHttp offers significant utility. By adopting the steps above, you can increase its resourcefulness and introspective power, and improve the quality of your application.
