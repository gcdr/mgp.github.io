  <h2>Hi, I'm Michael Parker.</h2>
  <p>These days I'm writing <em>Code is Craft</em>, a book to bridge the gap between writing code in school and writing code in industry.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was the lead developer on <a href="http://burnerapp.com/">Burner</a> at <a href="http://adhoclabs.co/">Ad Hoc Labs</a>, where I developed the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhoclabs.burner">Android application</a> and productionized the backend. Before that, I co-founded <a href="http://www.readyupapp.com/">ReadyUp!</a>, worked for almost five years at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> on <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/">enterprise search</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, and earned a BS and MS in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>.</p>

  <p>My slightly-outdated resume is available in <a href="/resume.html">HTML</a> or <a href="/resume.pdf">PDF</a> format.</p>

  <p>This site is generated using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and its source is <a href="https://github.com/mgp/mgp.github.io">freely available</a>.</p>
