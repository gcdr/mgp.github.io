  <h2>Hi, I'm Michael Parker.</h2>
  <p>Currently I work at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, which provides a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. I've helped develop both their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id469863705">iOS app</a> and their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.khanacademy.android">Android app</a>, both of which received <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/20/7560373/khan-academy-ipad-app-update">some</a> <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/09/16/khan-academy-is-bringing-its-library-of-lessons-to-android/">nice</a> <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2491870,00.asp">press</a>.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was the lead developer on <a href="http://burnerapp.com/">Burner</a> at <a href="http://adhoclabs.co/">Ad Hoc Labs</a>. There I developed the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhoclabs.burner">Android app</a>, and productionised the backend while increasing its test coverage from 0 to over 90%. Before that, I co-founded <a href="http://www.readyupapp.com/">ReadyUp!</a>, worked for almost five years at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> on <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/">enterprise search</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, and earned a BS and MS in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm also a founding volunteer of <a href="http://www.projectpossibility.org/">Project:Possibility</a>, through which I've <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/business/smallbusiness/18edge.html">mentored hundreds of college students</a> writing software to improve the lives of the physically disabled.</p>

  <p>My outdated resume is available in <a href="/resume.html">HTML</a> or <a href="/resume.pdf">PDF</a> format.</p>
