  <h2>Hi, I'm Michael Parker.</h2>
  <p>These days I'm writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/coding-in-the-real-world"><em>Coding is the Real World</em></a>, a book to bridge the gap between writing code in school and writing code in industry.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was the lead developer on <a href="http://burnerapp.com/">Burner</a> at <a href="http://adhoclabs.co/">Ad Hoc Labs</a>. There I developed the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhoclabs.burner">Android application</a>, which got <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/get-a-disposable-number-for-android-with-the-new-burner-app/">some</a> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5994268/burner-the-single+serving-phone-number-app-is-now-for-android">nice<a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5994262/burner-brings-disposable-phone-numbers-to-android-for-private-calls-texts-and-more">press</a>, and productionised the backend, where I increased test coverage from 0 to over 90%. Before that, I co-founded <a href="http://www.readyupapp.com/">ReadyUp!</a>, worked for almost five years at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> on <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/">enterprise search</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, and earned a BS and MS in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm also a founding volunteer of <a href="http://www.projectpossibility.org/">Project:Possibility</a>, through which I've <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/business/smallbusiness/18edge.html">mentored hundreds of college students</a> writing software to improve the lives of the physically disabled.</p>

  <p>My resume is available in <a href="/resume.html">HTML</a> or <a href="/resume.pdf">PDF</a> format.</p>
